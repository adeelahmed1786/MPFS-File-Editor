# MPFS-File-Editor
i wrote a MPFS File Editor which Edits the MPFS File
basically i created it for an smart alarm clock which has MPFS file ,who had html,js,css and some images files in it ,
i wante to change some code and wrap it back , but after studying format system of MPFS file , i thought to write a software which can automate the process instead of copy hexes and wasting time
